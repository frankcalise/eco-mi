## [Unreleased]

### Fix
- `isNewHighScore` flag now resets when using rewarded ad continue — previously showed the high score celebration a second time on the subsequent game-over
- Added input timeout to "waiting" state — players can no longer idle indefinitely mid-sequence. After `sequenceLength * 2000ms` with no input, the game ends. Timer clears on any button tap.
- Daily streak no longer leaks into non-daily mode stats — `recordGameResult()` was reading the daily streak key and copying it to `longestStreak` on every game-over regardless of mode. Streak-to-longest logic now only runs inside `saveDailyResult()` (daily mode only).
- Fix all missing diacritical marks in ES/PT translations (accents, cedillas, tildes)
- Replace hardcoded English "On"/"Off", "Unlock Sound/Theme" with i18n keys across settings
- Localize all 15 achievement titles and descriptions into ES/PT (previously English-only)
- Fix misleading ATT tracking screen copy: "Share Statistics" → "Allow Tracking"
- Add "Maybe Later" dismiss option and backdrop tap-to-dismiss on ReviewPrompt (previously forced binary choice)
- Add `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()` / `hideAsync()` — eliminates blank frame on cold start
- Wire up achievements and stats screen navigation from idle screen
- Invoke `checkAchievements()` on game over — achievements now actually unlock during gameplay
- Wrap settings modal content in `ScrollView` — Restore Purchases reachable on small screens

### Feat
- `PressableScale` reusable component — animated spring scale (0.96) + opacity (0.85) press feedback on all 26 action buttons across the app. Eliminates "dead tap" feel on every interactive element. Built on `react-native-ease` EaseView.
- `AnimatedNumber` component — rolling digit counter effect on Level, Score, and Best pill boxes. Numbers slide up/fade out and slide in/fade in on value change via spring animation (~300ms).
- Native screen transitions via Expo Router `<Stack>` — screens slide in from right (iOS native), tracking screen fades. No more hard cuts between routes.
- Game over sensory treatment: overlay fades/scales in (spring animation), descending minor jingle for regular game-over, triumphant ascending jingle for new high score, Success haptic on high score.
- Achievement unlock toasts — custom `AchievementToast` component (no reanimated dependency) with spring slide-in animation, auto-dismiss, achievement icon, and localized title/description in gold theme.

### Polish
- Safe area insets on achievements and stats screens (fixes Dynamic Island/Android cutouts)
- Touch targets: hitSlop on theme circles and sound pack selectors to meet 44pt Apple HIG minimum
- Progress dots switch to fraction display ("12/20") when sequence exceeds 15 items
- `playPreview` now respects `soundEnabled` toggle — no more unexpected audio when muted

### Test
- 68 unit tests (useGameEngine bugs, useHighScores, useStats, useAchievements, useStoreReview, game flow integration)
- 9 Maestro E2E flows: app-launches, happy-path, game-over, game-over-home, navigation, settings, mode-switch, leaderboard, tracking-screen — all passing
- Accessibility labels on back buttons (stats, achievements) — Maestro finds via a11y, doubles as VoiceOver support

### Feat
- `82368ac` — Gate themes and sound packs behind IAP with live preview UX. Classic free, others require purchase. Preview behind settings overlay, revert on dismiss, unlock buttons with RevenueCat purchase flow.

### Chore
- Remove unused deps: `@react-navigation/native-stack`, `react-native-drawer-layout`, `react-native-keyboard-controller` (Ignite boilerplate leftovers)
- Install and configure `expo-updates` with OTA update channels (development, preview, production) in `eas.json`
- Install and configure `expo-eas-observe` for production performance monitoring

### Feat
- `7adeb98` — Arcade-style local high score leaderboard: top 10 in MMKV, three-initial entry modal (retro CRT aesthetic), high score table with pulsing highlight, trophy button on idle screen
- `9997f61` — Sentry crash reporting (conditional on DSN env var), app-ads.txt placeholder
- `6255f7c` — GDPR/UMP consent flow before loading AdMob ads
- `8c81047` — Environment property (development/production) on all PostHog events
- `7aee920` — Smooth neon title crossfade with glow effect, game mode indicator under title
- `f5740fd` — Settings toggle animations, haptics on mode/settings, neon title, idle jingle
- `af8cb12` — Header action bar with mode selector (pulse animation), settings modal, game over home button

### Feat (Phase 2)
- `PENDING` — Add Lottie high score celebration animation in GameOverOverlay (placeholder trophy.json — replace with real animation from LottieFiles)
- `PENDING` — Replace all `Vibration.vibrate()` with `expo-haptics` in useGameEngine (Light for flash, Medium for touch, Error for game over)
- `PENDING` — Add sequence progress indicator (dot row) during "waiting" state showing playerSequence.length / sequence.length
- `PENDING` — Add rewarded video "Continue" mechanic: loadRewarded/showRewarded in useAds, continueGame in useGameEngine, "Watch Ad to Continue" button on GameOverOverlay (one per game)
- `PENDING` — Create store review pre-prompt system: `src/hooks/useStoreReview.ts` (guard logic: 5+ games, no ad this session) and `src/components/ReviewPrompt.tsx` (sentiment filter modal with "Love it!" / "Not really" paths)

### Feat (Phase 3)
- `PENDING` — Add seeded daily challenge mode using date-based RNG (`getDailySeed`), daily best score and streak tracking in MMKV
- `PENDING` — Create stats dashboard screen (`src/app/stats.tsx`) and `src/hooks/useStats.ts` with games played, best/average/total score, current/longest streak from MMKV
- `PENDING` — Implement achievement system: 15 achievements in `src/config/achievements.ts`, `src/hooks/useAchievements.ts` for check/unlock logic, `src/app/achievements.tsx` badge grid screen
- `PENDING` — Wire expo-sharing into GameOverOverlay share button with localized score message
- `PENDING` — Add Timed game mode (60s countdown, wrong input replays sequence instead of game over, tracks sequences completed)
- `PENDING` — Add Reverse game mode (player repeats sequence in reverse order)
- `PENDING` — Add Chaos game mode (button positions shuffle after each successful round)
- `PENDING` — Extract all game UI strings into `src/i18n/en.ts` (game, stats, achievements, review sections), replace hardcoded strings with `useTranslation()` across GameScreen, GameOverOverlay, ReviewPrompt, stats, and achievements screens
- `PENDING` — Add Spanish (`src/i18n/es.ts`) and Portuguese (`src/i18n/pt.ts`) translations (~30 strings each), register in i18n resources
- `PENDING` — Record game results to MMKV stats on every game over via `recordGameResult()`
- `PENDING` — Add `GameMode` type (`classic | daily | timed | reverse | chaos`) and `setMode` to useGameEngine, expose `buttonPositions` for chaos mode, `timeRemaining`/`sequencesCompleted` for timed mode

### Fix
- `f2cafd1` — Add `.catch()`/`.finally()` to `initI18n` in `_layout.tsx` to prevent white screen on i18n failure

### Feat
- `f2cafd1` — Create `src/config/difficulty.ts` with speed ramp functions (`getToneDuration`, `getSequenceInterval`, `getInputTimeout`)
- `f2cafd1` — Add seeded RNG (mulberry32) for deterministic test mode via `EXPO_PUBLIC_TEST_SEED` env var
- `f2cafd1` — Add `testID` props to all interactive and state-displaying elements per VISION.md conventions

### Test
- `f2cafd1` — Write 10 unit tests for `useGameEngine` covering state transitions, scoring, reset, timer cleanup, sound toggle, and seeded RNG

- `883666c` — Wire ads and IAP into game-over flow. Interstitial shown on game over, Remove Ads button on overlay, analytics events tracked. Replaced Modal with absolute-positioned overlay to fix AdMob conflict.

### Animation Polish
- `0dea72f` — Chaos mode shell game shuffle animations. 6 sequences chaining by level, smooth translateX/Y via EaseView, timing compresses at higher levels.
- `e327fdf` — Animated countdown number for timed mode. Spring-based scale/fade transition on each tick via AnimatedCountdown component.
- `1ff5497` — Circular progress ring with green→yellow→red color interpolation for timed mode. SVG ring depletes clockwise using theme button colors.

### Refactor
- `06afa99` — Extract `useGameEngine` hook from GameScreen. All game logic (state, timers, audio, scoring) in `src/hooks/useGameEngine.ts`. GameScreen is now presentation-only. Fixed orphaned timeout bugs, stale closures, stale Dimensions, and type hacks.

### Chore
- `8a04ad3` — Upgrade Expo SDK 53 → 55 (RN 0.83.4, React 19.2, React Compiler enabled). Converted app.json → app.config.ts with dynamic AdMob IDs from env vars. Installed all Phase 1–3 native deps. Removed unused boilerplate deps. Stripped unnecessary audio permissions. Confirmed on Android + iOS.
